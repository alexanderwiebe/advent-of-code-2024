# Advent of Code 2024 - Rust

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 solution in Rust! This year, I’m taking a more sustainable approach to the challenge: I will be spending **1 hour per day** working on each problem. This will help me avoid burnout and ensure that I keep making progress without feeling overwhelmed. Instead of aiming to solve one problem each day, I'll focus on dedicating consistent time each day, which should be a more manageable pace.

## Goals

- **Time Boxed**: Spend **1 hour per day** on each problem, rather than trying to solve them all in one sitting.
- **Rust Focus**: Solve all problems using **Rust** as my primary language.
- **Learn and Improve**: This challenge is not only about solving the problems but also improving my Rust skills and exploring different features of the language.
- **No Pressure**: I’ll keep things simple and enjoyable to avoid burnout by pacing myself.

## Approach

1. **Time Limiting**: I will allocate exactly one hour per day to solve the problem. If I don't finish within the hour, I’ll move on and try to improve the solution the next day.
2. **Solution Iteration**: I will revisit previous days' problems for better solutions or optimizations once the challenge is over.
3. **Daily Logging**: Each day, I’ll log my progress and any notes related to my thought process, challenges, or learnings.

## Directory Structure
Using rust workspaces where each day is its own workspace

## How to Run

To compile and run the Rust solutions:

1. **Install Rust**: If you haven’t already installed Rust, follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexanderwiebe/advent-of-code-2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   <todo>
   ```
3. **Run the solution for a day**: Each day, the problem will have its own folder (e.g., day00, day01). You can run the solution using the cargo run command from within the relevant folder.

Example for day 1:
```bash
cargo run -p day01
```

## Day-by-Day Progress
### Day 0: 
Started the challenge and set up the basic structure. Worked on solving the first problem with a focus on the initial implementation in Rust.
### Day 1: 
(Add your progress and notes here)

(Continue adding daily notes and progress throughout the month)

## Challenges Faced
* Time Management: Balancing this challenge with daily responsibilities can be tricky. The time-boxing approach helps prevent overwhelm.
* Rust Learning: Some days required looking up new features of Rust. Each challenge is an opportunity to deepen my understanding of the language.

## Future Improvements
Optimize my solutions with Rust’s performance features.
Explore more Rust libraries and tools for solving these problems more efficiently.
